## 1. Project description:
The titanic dataset describe the survival status of the Titanic passengers. It also contains information on passenger class, ticket fare, gender, age, number of siblings/spouses aboard, number of parents/children aboard, ticket number, cabin number and port of embarkation. The aim of this report was to test three differet Ensemble Classifiers from sklearn: Bagging, Random Forest and Ada Boost to choose one that would be best at predicting passenger survival.

## 2. The project contains the following analyses: 
* **Data pre-processing and splitting into train-test sets** 
* **Fitting each of the three models on train data:**
* **Calculating accuracy scores for each model**
* **Optimising parameters for the models**
* **Choosing the most accurate model for predicting survival**
